## Introduction

These **creamy boiled potatoes** transform humble ingredients into an elegant side dish. The key is **perfectly cooked potatoes** paired with a velvety herb-infused cream sauce. This recipe works wonderfully with roasted meats or as part of a vegetarian spread.

## Pro Tips Before You Start

1. **Potato selection**: Choose waxy potatoes like Yukon Gold or red potatoes - they hold their shape better when boiled.
2. **Even cooking**: Cut potatoes into uniform sizes so they cook at the same rate.
3. **Salt your water**: Like pasta, potatoes absorb salt best during cooking.
4. **Don't overcook**: Test with a fork at 12 minutes - they should be tender but not falling apart.

## Step-by-Step Cooking Guide

### Step 1: Prepare the Potatoes

Peel and cut potatoes into **2-inch chunks**. Place in a pot of cold **salted water** (about 1 tbsp salt per liter). Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook for **15-18 minutes** until just tender.

**Chef's Tip:** Starting in cold water ensures even cooking throughout the potatoes.

### Step 2: Make the Cream Sauce

While potatoes cook, melt **butter** in a saucepan over medium heat. Add **minced garlic** and **thyme**, saut√©ing for 30 seconds until fragrant. Pour in **cream** and simmer for 3 minutes to thicken slightly. Finish with **lemon juice**, **salt**, and **pepper**.

**Pro Technique:** The acid from lemon juice balances the richness and prevents the cream from tasting too heavy.

### Step 3: Combine and Serve

Drain potatoes well and return to the warm pot. Gently fold in the cream sauce and **chopped parsley**. Let stand for 2 minutes to allow flavors to meld.

**Serving Suggestion:** Garnish with extra parsley and a grind of black pepper for visual appeal.

## Final Thoughts

This **deceptively simple dish** showcases how quality ingredients and proper technique can elevate basic potatoes. The creamy sauce clings beautifully to each tender piece, while the herbs provide freshness. For variations, try adding grated Parmesan or a pinch of smoked paprika.

**Storage Tip:** Leftovers can be refrigerated for 3 days. Reheat gently with a splash of milk to refresh the sauce.
