## Step-by-Step Cooking Guide

### Step 1: Cook the Pasta

Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add spaghetti and cook until al dente. **Don't overcook!**  
_Tip:_ Reserve **¬Ω cup of pasta water** before draining ‚Äì you may need it later for the sauce.

<CookingStep action="boiling" />

### Step 2: Crisp the Pancetta

Heat a pan over medium heat and cook the pancetta until it‚Äôs golden and crispy. This releases flavorful fats, which add richness to the dish.  
_Tip:_ If pancetta isn‚Äôt available, try guanciale (more authentic) or streaky bacon (more accessible).

<CookingStep action="frying" />

### Step 3: Prepare the Sauce

In a bowl, whisk the eggs and mix in the grated Parmesan. This forms the base of the **luxurious creamy sauce**. Add some black pepper for extra depth of flavor.  
_Tip:_ **Use only egg yolks** for a richer texture.

### Step 4: Combine Everything

Remove the pan from the heat. Add the hot pasta and **immediately** mix in the egg-cheese mixture. Toss quickly to prevent the eggs from scrambling.  
If needed, add some reserved pasta water for a silkier consistency.

### Step 5: Serve & Enjoy!

Plate the Carbonara, sprinkle with extra Parmesan, and finish with **a fresh grind of black pepper**.

## üçΩ Final Thoughts
